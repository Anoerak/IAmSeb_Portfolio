				<p class='p__element 1'>
					👋 Hey there! I'm Sébastien, a passionate full-stack web developer with a love for crafting seamless digital
														experiences. With a blend of creativity and technical work, I thrive on transforming ideas into functional and
														visually stunning applications.
				</p>
				<p class='p__element 2'>
					🌐 My journey in the world of web development began several years ago, and since then, I've had the privilege of
														working on a diverse range of projects that have honed my skills across the entire stack. From architecting robust
														backends that handle (kind of 😅) complex data flows to designing intuitive user interfaces that prioritize user
														engagement, I'm dedicated to delivering excellence at every stage.
				</p>
				<p class='p__element 3'>
					🛠️ My toolkit is brimming with a variety of technologies, including but not limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
															Node.js, and SQL. I revel in the challenge of staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and integrating
															cutting-edge tools to elevate the quality of my work. I'm a firm believer in the power of continuous learning, and
															I'm always excited to embrace new technologies that can push the boundaries of what's possible.
				</p>
				<p class='p__element 4'>
					🌟 Beyond the code, I'm a strong advocate for user-centered design and seamless functionality. I firmly believe that
														a successful web application should not only look visually appealing but also provide a smooth and intuitive user
														experience. In a perfect world, each line of code I write would represent my dedication to crafting solutions that
														meet those expectations.
				</p>
				<p class='p__element 5'>
					🚀 When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me exploring the world, trying to teach but also to learn to
														and from my son and partner, or immersing myself in a good movie or some good music (country, if you read this 😉).
														I'm a firm believer in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, as I find that it greatly fuels my creativity and
														problem-solving abilities when I know that I don't have to count the time spent with my family. I also enjoy
														practicing yoga and swimming, hiking, play video games and reading.
				</p>
				<p class='p__element 6'>
					🤝 If you're looking for a collaborative and driven developer to join your team or contribute to your project, I'd
														love to connect! Whether it's brainstorming new ideas, optimizing existing systems, or tackling fresh challenges,
														I'm always ready to embark on new coding adventures.
				</p>
				<p class='p__element 7'>
					Thanks for stopping by and taking a glimpse into my world of web development. Let's create something amazing
														together!
